## About King's Speech Archive

This is a Laravel-based application that essentially organizes all of the episodes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_King_(drummer)" target="__blank">Dave King</a>'s ( former :( ) radio show <a href="https://www.thecurrent.org/programs/kings-speech/" target="__blank">King's Speech</a>.

All episode "Listen" links direct to the cooresponding episode page on The Current's website.

Really happenin' features:
- Sort by Year
- Sort by Episode Type (Diamond Collection or Jazz Fight)
- Real-time episode search feature
- Get a Jazz Education from Dave & Joe
- Get "the gig"
- Dark Mode (only for me)

## Why?

I listen to this show's archives a lot, and navigigating through The Current's website archive was a nightmare (no offense).

The Current: I did not download any episodes; they are merely just links to your website. :)

"I'm serious man! Check it out."
